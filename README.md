This was made for ICS3U as part of my first foray into the world of Java.
The game is made up of several animations and a gripping storyline, with minigames sprinkled in for good measure.
It may not be the prettiest, but it really let me run wild with the few tools I had at my disposal.
A very good learning experience.
